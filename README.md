# picoGPT

An even more minimalist implementation of GPT2. Inspired by [nanoGPT](https://github.com/karpathy/nanoGPT/). Focused on readability and clarity.

In addition GPT2, this includes a clear implementation of:

- PyTorch basic layers (Linear, LayerNorm, Dropout, Embedding)
- Pytorch functionals (softmax, cross_entropy, gelu)
- a data loader and a decoder
- AdamW with clipping, and a cosine scheduler with warmup
